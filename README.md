# Description

We have seen so far what React is and what it is capable of. To summarise in brief we got to know what React web-apps are, React Components, Props, States and lifecycle of a React component. We also created a basic clock application using all of the following. But React is a javascript library to build flexible User Interfaces, and we have not created any so far. So it is time for us to step into the real world of React by creating a simple yet impactful project.

# Task

No more than 1 components per file. Additionals components will be in src/components/

CSS will be in a file associated to the component: css for ExampleComponent.js will be in ExampleComponent.css.

Your Readme will have to describe the project.

On the css/colors/design, you can be creative.

Your project will be hosted in the cloud (AWS/Gcloud/Azure/Netlify/...) and you write the url in my_reactjs_calculator_url.txt. Nothing more, just the URL.

Create a ReactJS Application. It will be a single route application.

You will be able to perform all simple operation: +-/*

It should display the result of the operation.

You should be able to do multiple operation. You should be able to clear the buffer.
